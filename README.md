## Project: "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).


**You can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).** Note that it requires the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html).

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy.txt](tidy.txt).**

Analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
